    <h1>This is Pen Guinie the penguin. During the migration
    he got separated from his flock and his time away from
    society made him into an ice-cold killer. By day he's
    a cute cuddly peinguino, but by night he become the waddling
    assassin, terrorizing his predators and saving himself from
    being eaten.</h1>
